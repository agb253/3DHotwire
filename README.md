# 3DHotwire
This program takes GCODE from 3D printer slicer software and synchronizes the coordinates for use with a polargraph type hot wire foam cutter, so it can cut 3D shapes with tapered lofts and skews.

The foam cutter can be seen at https://adamblumhagen.net/foam-cutter/
How I manually extracted the coordinates from GCODE and synchronized the coordinates to cut a 3D turbine can be found here: https://adamblumhagen.net/foam-cutter-cutting-a-turbine-blade/
